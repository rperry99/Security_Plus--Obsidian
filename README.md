# SY0-601 Security+ Notes
This is my Obsidian vault for my Security+ notes. 
I am currently studying for the SY0-601 Certificate. Even though the SY0-701 is the most current one, there are vastly more resources for studying the 601. I have until July to take this test to get the certificate.

# What is contained here?
Basically, this is my note taking system for learning new things. One of the ways I like to use to learn new material is to take notes on it, and then have everything linked together so that if I am on some page, I can easily click around to get more information on something else.

There is an added benefit here as well, that with "linking my thinking", I can more easily make connections to different pieces of information, and I can better see how different topics might relate.

# The SY0-601 Dashboard
This page is essentially being used as a hub for the notes. This way, I do not have to manually search the long list of notes.

To accomplish this, I am using Dataview, along with tags to sort things into different categories.
- `#Acronym` | To have a complete list of all the acronyms recommended to learn for the test.
- `#SocialEngineering` | Notes taken from the "Social Engineering" part of the course.

# Obsidian Plugins Used
- [Dataview](https://blacksmithgu.github.io/obsidian-dataview/) - Lets me generate lists and graphs of my different pages. Each note will show you a list of related notes, sorted alphabetically. The SY0-601 Dashboard page will aggregate all the new stuff I add automatically, so long as I use the tags mentioned above.
- [Templater](https://github.com/SilentVoid13/Templater) - Lets me use templates within Obsidian to make faster notes.

# Updates
### `3-1-24 Update`
- I am well into my journey of learning this material, but I am just now staring the process of making these notes and linking them.
