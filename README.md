# SY0-601 Security+ Notes
This is my Obsidian vault for my Security+ notes. 
I am currently studying for the SY0-601 Certificate. Even though the SY0-701 is the most current one, there are vastly more resources for studying the 601. I have until July to take this test to get the certificate.

# What is contained here?
Basically, this is my note taking system for learning new things. One of the ways I like to use to learn new material is to take notes on it, and then have everything linked together so that if I am on some page, I can easily click around to get more information on something else.

There is an added benefit here as well, that with "linking my thinking", I can more easily make connections to different pieces of information, and I can better see how different topics might relate.

- I am well into my journey of learning this material, but I am just now staring the process of making these notes and linking them.
