# How does it work?
- It starts with [[Pretexting]]
	- "Hello sir, my name is Wendy and I'm from Microsoft Windows. This is an urgent check up call for your computer as we have found several problems with it."
- This leads into the impersonation.
	- Attackers pretend to be someone they aren't, basically like Halloween for the attackers.
	- They can use some of the details they picked up from [[Reconnaissance]] to make it seem like they know you.
	- They can use this information to pretend to be someone higher than you, like a CEO or someone from the Help Desk.
	- They can even try to throw a ton of technical information around to try to confuse you.
	- They can try to be your friend and be very friendly; "How about them browns?"
# Eliciting Information
- [[Eliciting Information]] is when the attacker can get the victim to voluntarily give the attacker some sort of information. 
	- This can be referred to as "Hacking the Human".
- This is often seen with [[Vishing]].
- The attackers use well documented psychological techniques. They can't just as, "So, what's your password?"
# What can attackers gain from this?
- Identity theft is one of the main things an attacker can get.
- If an attacker has your personal information they got from eliciting information, then they can use this information to impersonate you which can lead to:
	- Credit Card Fraud: Opening accounts in your name.
	- Bank Fraud: Pretending to be you to withdraw all your money.
	- Loan Fraud: using your name to open a loan.
	- Government Benefits Fraud: Attacker obtains government benefits on your behalf.
# How to protect yourself from Impersonation?
- Never volunteer information
- Don't disclose personal details
- Always verify before revealing information.
	- Call back the number, or verify through 3rd parties.
- Verification should be encouraged.
