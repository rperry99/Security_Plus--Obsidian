# What is it?
- It's a two-way wireless communication, that builds on [[Radio-Frequency Identification (RFID)|RFID]], which is mostly one-way.
- This is often used in payment systems where you "tap".
- NFC can also help with [[Bluetooth]] pairing.
- An example could also be something like an Access Token, short range with encryption support.

# NFC Security Concerns
- Data can be intercepted and captured.
	- It's essentially a wireless network with 10 meters for active devices.
- Susceptible to [[Wireless Jamming|frequency jamming]] causing a [[Denial of Service (DoS)|DoS]].
- Susceptible to [[Replay Attacks]] and [[Relay Attacks]]
- You can also straight up lose your NFC device (like losing your phone, or getting it stolen).
