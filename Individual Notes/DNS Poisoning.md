# What is DNS Poisoning?
- Modifying the [[Domain Name System (DNS)]] server, which requires some tricky hacking.
- The attacker modifies the client host file, which takes precedent over [[Domain Name System (DNS)|DNS]] queries.
- The attacker then sends a fake response to a valid [[Domain Name System (DNS)|DNS]] request, which requires a redirection of the original request of the resulting response.
