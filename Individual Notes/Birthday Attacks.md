# What is it?
- In a classroom of 23 students, what is the chance of 2 students sharing the same birthday? 50%
	- For a class of 30, the chance is about 70%
- In the digital world, this would be considered a [[Hashing#^c8c569|collision]].
	- These collisions can be found through [[Password Brute-Force|brute force]].
- The attacker will generate multiple versions of [[Plaintext]] to match the hashes.

# Protecting yourself
- Protect yourself with a large hash output size.
