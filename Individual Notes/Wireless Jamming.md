# What is it?
- Also called [[Radio Frequency (RF)]] jamming
- This is a [[Denial of Service (DoS)|denial of service]] attack to prevent wireless communication.
- It makes it hard for a device to communicate with a network.
- This can be either intentional or unintentional.

# How does it happen?
- Transmit interfereing wireless signels
	- Decrease the signal-to-noise ratio at the receiving device
	- The receiving device can't hear the good signal.
- Sometimes it's unintentional
	- a microwave oven or fluorescent lights might interfere with the signal.
- "Jamming" is intentional. Someone wants your network to not work.
- The attacker needs to be close, as it's difficult to be effective from a distance.

# Methods of Wireless Jamming
- Constant, random bits
- Constant, legitimate frames.
- Data sent at random times
	- Random data and legitimate frames
- Reactive Jamming
	- Only when someone else tries to communicate.

# How to stop it
- Essentially, you have to go fox hunting.
- Something like a directional antenna or an attenuator can track down the jam and then you can stop it.
