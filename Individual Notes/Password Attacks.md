# What is it
- These are the various ways an attacker might try to find and utilize your password across any and all websites.

# Types of Password Attacks
- [[Password Brute-Force|brute force attack]] - An attacker will try every single possible password until something sticks.
- [[Dictionary Attacks]] - Uses a dictionary to find common words to be used as a password.
- [[Rainbow Tables]] - An optimized, pre-built set of hashes that can be used as a guessing point.
- [[Spraying Attacks]] - An attacker will try a few common passwords in hopes to get in, stopping before they get locked out. 

# Avoiding a Password Attack
- Never store your passwords as [[Plaintext]]. Anyone can read and access these relatively easy.
- Make sure you run your passwords through a [[Hashing]] algorithm (on most (secure) applications, this is done automatically.)
- Add some [[Salting|Salt]]
