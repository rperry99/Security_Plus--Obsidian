# What is it?
- [[Social Engineering]] with a touch of [[Spoofing]]. 
- It's usually delivered via email, text, etc., but it can also be done via voice.

# Trickery of Phishing
- [[Typosquatting]] is a type of [[URL Hijacking]] where you can either spell something slightly wrong (gooogle) or use "prepending" (ggoogle) to trick users.
- [[Pretexting]] is lying to get information. 
	- An attacker comes up with a story and play a character in that story. 
	- "Hi, we're calling from Visa regarding an automated payment to your utility service."

# Types of Phishing
- [[Pharming]] - Large scale phishing attempt to try to get as many people as possible.
- [[Vishing]] - Phishing over voice / telephone calls.
- [[Smishing]] - Phishing over SMS / Text Messaging
- [[Spear Phishing]] - A form of phishing where you are targeting a specific person.
	- [[Whaling]] - A subset of spear phishing, where you are targeting a high profile target like a CEO / CFO.
# Finding the best spot to Phish
- The attacker has to use [[Reconnaissance]] to get info on the victim. 
- They can use information from public places:
	- Lead Generation Sites
	- LinkedIn, Twitter, Facebook, Instagram
	- Corporate Websites
- The attacker will then build a believable [[Pretexting|pretext]] based on the information they know about you.
