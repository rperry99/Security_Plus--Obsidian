# What is a bot?
- Once your machine is infected it can become a bot for the attacker to use at any time.
- It will sit around waiting. It will check in with the [[Command & Control (C&C)]] server for instructions.

# What is a botnet?
- A group of bots that work together, nothing good can come from this.

## What's bad about a botnet?
- With enough bots, you could do a [[Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)]].
- It can also cause [[Relay Spam]], increase proxy network traffic, and utilize [[Distributed Computing Attacks]].
- Botnets are often for sale.
	- You can rent time from the botnet owner
	- Usually not a long-term business proposition. 

# Stopping the Bot
- Prevent the initial infection by making sure your [[Operating System (OS)|OS]] and applications are up to date.
- Make sure you [[Anti-Virus (AV)|anti-virus]] and [[Anti-Malware]] are up to date with the latest [[Malware Signatures|signatures]].
- Identify an existing infection by using on-demand scans and network monitoring. 
- Prevent the [[Command & Control (C&C)|C&C]] by blocking it at the [[Firewalls|firewall]].
	- You can also identify at the workstation with a host-based [[Firewalls|firewall]] or a host-based [[Intrusion Prevention System (IPS)|IPS]].
