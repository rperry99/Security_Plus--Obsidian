# What is it?
- TLS 1.0 was an upgrade from [[Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)|SSL]] 3.0, and also included a name change from SSL to TLS.
	- There was a flaw where it could downgrade to SSL 3.0, which is bad. See [[Padding Oracle on Downgraded Legacy Encryption (POODLE)|POODLE]].
- TLS 1.0 was depreciated in January 2020 by modern browsers.
- TLS 1.2 and TLS 1.3 are considered the latest standards (As of 2020, when the course was written).
