# What is it?
- A dictionary can be used to find common words, considering passwords are made by humans
	- You might even be able to find career specific dictionaries.
- Many common wordlists are available on the internet, some even customized by language or line of work.
- The password crackers can also substitute letters for symbols --> p&ssw0rd
- These take a lot of time
- [[Distributed Cracking]] and [[GPU Cracking]] is common
- One drawback is this cannot crack random character passwords like ones generated via a generator.
