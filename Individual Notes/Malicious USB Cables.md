# What is it?
- It looks like a normal [[Universal Serial Bus (USB)|USB]] cable but has additional electronics inside.
- An [[Operating System (OS)|operating system]] will identify it as a [[Human Interface Device (HID)|HID]] so that it looks like you just plugged in a keyboard or a mouse.
	- A keyboard doesn't need any extra rights or permissions.
- Once connected, the cable takes over and will download and install [[Malware]].
