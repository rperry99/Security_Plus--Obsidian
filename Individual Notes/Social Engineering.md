# What is it?
- Basically, it's ways that attackers can get information from people, or get information in-front of people.
# Principles of Social Engineering
- Effective social engineering is constantly changing. You never know what an attacker will use next.
- Sometimes, it could be multiple people doing the engineering, not just one. 
- This can also be in person, or over the internet. Nobody is safe.
## The Principles
- Authority
	- The social engineer is in charge
	- *"I'm calling from the desk/office of the CEO/Police".*
- Intimidation
	- There will be bad things if you don't help.
	- *"If you don't help me, the payroll checks won't be processed."*
- Consensus / Social Proof
	- Convince based on what's normally expected
	- _"You're co-worker Jill did this for me last week"._
- Scarcity
	- The situation will not be this way for long
	- Must make the change before it expires.
- Urgency
	- Works hand in hand with Scarcity
	- Act quickly, don't think.
- Trust
	- It's coming from someone who is safe
	- *"I'm from IT, and I'm here to help!"*
