# What is it?
- Use an authorized person to gain unauthorized access to a building, on purpose.
- "Attackers" can blend in with clothing.
	- They can wear a maintenance uniform, etc., and can learn how people dress there using [[Reconnaissance|recon]].
- They can temporarily take up smoking, and sit in the smoking area, and just go in when someone else goes in. 
- Bringing food also seems to be an effective way to get in this way.
# Watching for Tailgating
- Many companies have visitor policies where you need to check in before gaining access.
- A policy of "One Scan, One Person".
	- Though policies can be unenforced.
- Using a Mantrap / Airlock, where a physical person has to let every person in, and they will have to be questioned regardless.
- Don't be afraid to ask, who are you and why are you here?
