# What is it?
- An attack can happen at any point on the [[Supply Chain]]. 
- Attackers can infect any step along the way, which can then infect the other parts of the chain without suspicion. 
- One exploit can affect the entire chain. 

# Supply Chain Security
- Can you trust your new server / router / switch / firewall / software?
- Even [[Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC)|HVAC]] companies can cause an issue. 
- Use a small supplier base, they have tighter control of vendors.
- Strict controls over policies and procedures
- Security should be part of the overall design, there's a limit to trust.
