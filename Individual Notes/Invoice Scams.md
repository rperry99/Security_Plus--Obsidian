# What is it?
- It starts with [[Spear Phishing]], the attacker needs to know who pays the bills.
- The attacker then sends a fake invoice
	- Something like a domain renewal, toner cartridges, etc.
	- The `FROM:` address is spoofed to look like it was from the CEO or something.
- Accounting then pays the invoice, it was from the CEO afterall...
# Concerns
- These invoice scams also have the potential to have links to pay within the emails. 
- If the accounting department pays via these links, then the attacker now has the company's banking information / payment details.
