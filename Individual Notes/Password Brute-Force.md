# What is it?
- Also called a brute force attack
- The attacker will try every possible password combination until the hash is matched.
- These usually take some time, as a strong hashing algorithm can slow this down.

# Two different types
- Online
	- Keep trying the login process
	- Very slow
	- Most accounts will lockout after a number of failed attempts.
- Offline
	- Obtain the list of users and hashes
	- Calculate a password hash, compare it to a stored hash
	- Large computational resource requirement.
