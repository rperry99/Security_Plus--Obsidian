# What is it? 
- This is a form of [[Malware]] that is different every time it's downloaded.
- It is made to appear different each time 
	- Add [[No Operation (NOP)|NOP]] Instructions
		- No Operation Instructions: It doesn't do anything functionally, but it makes the piece of malware look different.
	- Loops and pointless code.
- These can gererally redesign themselves
	- Reorder functions
	- Modify the application flow
	- Reorder code and insert unused data types
- They are difficult to match with [[Malware Signatures|signature]]-based detection, so using a layered approach woudl be best.
