# What is it?
- It stands for "malicious software".
- It can do a wide variety of things like gather keystrokes, turn your computer into a bot for a [[Bots & Botnets|botnet]], infect your computer with [[Viruses]] or [[Worms]], or even advertise things to you. 

# Malware Types and Methods
- [[Viruses]]
- [[Crypto-Malware]]
- [[Ransomware]]
- [[Worms]]
- [[Trojan Horses]]
- [[Rootkits]]
- [[Keyloggers]]
- [[Adware]] / [[Spyware]]
- [[Bots & Botnets|botnets]]

# How do you get malware?
- All of these forms of malware can work together.
	- A [[Worms|worm]] can take advantage of a vulnerability that then installs malware that includes a remote access [[Backdoors|backdoor]]. Once the backdoor is installed, a [[Bots & Botnets|bot]] can be installed at any time.
- In order to get malware, your computer has to run a program.
	- These programs can be run from email links, web page pop-ups, [[Drive-by Downloads]], or [[Worms]].
- Your computer itself has vulnerabilities.
	- Your [[Operating System (OS)]] should always be kept updated
	- Applications can either have vulnerabilities in them, or they themselves can be a virus. Always do research on what you are downloading
