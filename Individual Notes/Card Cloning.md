# What is it?
- An attacker can get the card details from a [[Card Skimming|skimmer]] and then will duplicate the card.
- It can look and feel identical to the original, and often includes the printed [[Card Validation Code (CVC)]].
- The drawback is that it can only clone the magnetic stripe cards, as a chip cannot be cloned.
- This is very common in gift cards.
