# What is Bluesnarfing
- An attacker accesses a [[Bluetooth]]-enabled device and transfers data like a contact list, calendar, email, pictures, video, etc.
- This was considered the first security weakness in [[Bluetooth]].
	- This weakness has since been patched.
- It was a serious security issue

# Is this still a threat?
- Only on older devices. Modern [[Bluetooth]] devices do not have this vulnerability.
