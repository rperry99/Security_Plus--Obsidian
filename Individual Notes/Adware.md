# What is it?
- A form of [[Malware]] that turns your computer into one big advertisements.
- Pop-ups will show up all the time on your computer.
- This can also cause performance issues, especially over the network. 
- Typically these are installed accidentally and may be included with other software ([[Trojan Horses|trojan]]).

# Things to be wary of
- Be careful of software that claims to remove adware, especially if you learned about it from a pop-up.

# Protecting from Adware
- Maintain your [[Anti-Virus (AV)|anti-virus]] and [[Anti-Malware]] keeping it up to date.
- Always know what programs you are installing, and watch the default selected options when installing.
- Keep a backup, especially an offline one.
- Run some scans, using something like Malwarebytes.
