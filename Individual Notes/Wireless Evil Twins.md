# What is a Wireless Evil Twin?
- A wireless network that looks legitimate, but is actually malicious.
	- Think of it as a wireless version of [[Phishing]].

# How do they work?
- An attacker configures their [[Access Point (AP)|access point]] to look like an existing network.
	- Uses the same (or similar) [[Server Set Identifier (SSID)|SSID]] and security settings / captive portal.
- The attacker can use their evil twin to overpower the existing access points.
	- They may or may not require the same physical location.
- [[Rogue Access Points|Wi-Fi Hotspots]] (and users) are easy to fool, and are typically wide open.

# Protecting yourself
- Encrypt your communications, using websites with [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS)|HTTPS]] and a [[Virtual Private Network (VPN)|VPN]].
