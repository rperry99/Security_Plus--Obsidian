# What is a hoax?
- A threat that doesn't actually exist, but it seems like it _could_ be real.
- It's often an email, facebook post, tweet, etc. 
- An example could be something like an image that pops up saying you have a virus. It might not even do anything, but its trying to get you to think you do.
- Some hoaxes will take your money, but not though electronic means.
# De-hoaxing
- Believe nobody.
- Cross reference using sites like http://www.hoax-slayer.net or http://www.snopes.com
- Use spam filters like in your email.
- If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is.
