# What is it?
- This is [[Malware]] that spies on you.
	- The benefit of this is for targeting advertisements to you, and learning about you to commit identity theft or affiliate fraud. 
- You can be tricked into installing this either via [[Peer to Peer (P2P)]] or fake security software (often a [[Trojan Horses|trojan]]). 

# Protecting from Spyware
- Maintain your [[Anti-Virus (AV)|anti-virus]] and [[Anti-Malware]] keeping it up to date.
- Always know what programs you are installing, and watch the default selected options when installing.
- Keep a backup, especially an offline one.
- Run some scans, using something like Malwarebytes.
