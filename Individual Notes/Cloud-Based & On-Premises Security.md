# Attacks can happen anywhere
- There are two categories for IT security
	- The on-premises data is more secure!
	- The cloud data is more secure!

# Cloud-Based Security
- Centralized and costs less
- No dedicated hardware, no data center to secure
- A third-party handles everything.
## The Benefits
- Data is in a secure environment with no physical access to the data center.
- Cloud providers are managing large-scale security with automated [[Malware Signatures|signature]] and security updates.
- There's limited downtime. Also have extensive [[Fault Tolerance]] and 24/7/365 monitoring
- Scalable security options with one-click security deployments.
## The Drawbacks
- A third-party may have access to your data.
- The users must follow strict security best-practices.
- Even though it's scalable, it may not be as customizable as necessary.

# On-Premises Security
- Puts the security burden on the client
- There are data center security and infrastructure costs.
## The Benefits
- Customize your security posture. You have full control when everything is in-house.
- On-Site IT team can manage security better.
- Local team maintains uptime and availability
	- A system check can occur at any time
	- No phone call for support.
## The Drawbacks
- A local IT team can be expensive and difficult to staff.
