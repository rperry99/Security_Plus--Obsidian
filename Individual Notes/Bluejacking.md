# What is Bluejacking?
- Sending of unsolicited messages to another device via [[Bluetooth]], meaning no mobile carrier is required.
- The typical functional distance is about 10 meters, but can be more or less, depending on antenna and interference.
- Bluejacking is only sending images or text, so it's relatively harmless.

# Protecting yourself
- You can use third-party tools like Blooover or Bluesniff.
