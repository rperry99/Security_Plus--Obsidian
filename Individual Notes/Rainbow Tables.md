# What is it?
- An optimized, pre-built set of [[Hashing|hashes]].
- It saves time and storage space.
- It doesn't need to contain _every_ hash, but it does contain pre-calculated hash chains.
- An attacker can essentially do a V-Lookup to see if the password they are looking for is within this table. 
- Different hashing methods requires different tables.
	- Windows is different than MySQL
